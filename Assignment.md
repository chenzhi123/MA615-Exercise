# Assignment 

Using our class discussions and this document as a starting point, produce an EDA report.  The report should describe
the data itself so that readers understand the data sources used in the report and how you cleaned and organized the data for analysis.

The sections below suggest how the report might be organized.  The report should be succinct, communicating the information that you believe will be helpful to someone doing a fuller analysis of the data or using the data for model building.  Implementation details should be included in commentary that is included in code.

Sections of the document as it was originally presented in class have been commented so that you can see them in the code.


## Data acquisition and assessment  

  - Data sources   
  - Assumptions and motivations  

## Data cleaning and organization   

Outline the approach taked to clean and organize the data.

## Initial questions

  - Initial questions about strawberries, the data, and about the work you are undertaking.  Write these before you begin working.




## The data

Describe the source and original condition of the data: organization, problems with the data that needed to be addressed and so on.  Cite data sources.

The data set for this assignment has been selected from: [USDA_NASS](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov) <br> The data have been stored on NASS here: [USDA_NASS_strawb_2023SEP19](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/45FBC825-B104-38E2-9802-839F5F3C7036)


Make relevant observations in the document and in your code about data. Add commentary to the code so that anthoer analysts
could use or extend your code.

Discusss missing data, inclding how you handled it.  Be careful to point out where NA's are being produced during processing and are not data missing in the original data.

Where it is relevant, include information of how you have organized the data for analysis.  It might, for example, be helpful to know that there is both agricultural census data and survey data. It might be helpful to discuss data that appears to be redundant between these two sources.

Make sure you include details in your discussion and in your code about other data and information you used in your work.  Cite sources and provide detail that would allow another analyst to reproduce your work.

EDA 

Once the data has been cleaned and organized, you must conduct your own EDA. Be sure to include a discussion of your analysis of the chemical information, including citations for data and other information you have used. Visualizations should play a key role in your analysis. Plots should be labeled and captioned.
